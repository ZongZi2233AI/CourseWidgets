### 📦 Latest Release: [v2.5.7](https://github.com/ZongZi2233AI/CourseWidgets/releases/tag/v2.5.7)

#### v2.5.7 Release Notes (2026-02-28)
- 🎨 **UI Quality Leap**: Removed the global grey hard stroke border from standard glass, universally adopting natural specular shadows to define boundaries while preserving side metallic reflections.
- ⚡ **Animation & Experience Optimization**:
  - **Predictive Back Optimization**: Fixed the issue where the background flashes to the previous page during 2nd/3rd level page swiping, adding a smooth 0.95 to 1.0 scaling and fade-in transition.
  - **Windows Core Experience**: Fixed DPI anomalies during full screen (half black/squished) and the black background flashing issue during minimize/restore.
  - **Loading Experience Improvement**: Adapted to system dark/light modes, fixing the brief black screen flash on app launch.
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed the issue with multiple grey DragHandles appearing when the theme color settings menu pops up.
  - Perfectly adapted to and resolved compilation compatibility warnings related to AGP 9.0.
